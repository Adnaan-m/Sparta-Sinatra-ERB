# Sparta-Sinatra-ERB

The following ReadMe provides information regarding a task set to create a basic server rendering website using ruby, html and bootstrap. From all tasks, this would be considered the hardest one to comprehend and was definitely a challenge to write from scratch. Seen as though it is the first time using ruby, it can only get better!

### Languages used
* Ruby
* HTML
* CSS (Bootstrap)

### How to download
1. Search for Adnaan-m in GitHub. [Click Here](https://github.com/Adnaan-m/Sparta-Sinatra-ERB) for the link.
2. Search for the Sparta-Sinatra-ERB repository.
3. Download the files displayed.

### Challenges
1. The first challenge that was approached was the implementation of the syntax and features of ruby to support server-side rendering.
2. Another challenge was initiating random ID's for new fields to prevent issues of duplicate ID fields. The following code was used which worked for the initiation but caused bugs when trying to load the data onto the GET SHOW page.

```rb 
prng = Random.new
  id = prng.rand(10...100)
```
### Learning points
Back end server-side rendering is a logical step-by-step process that needs to be completed a step at a time.
